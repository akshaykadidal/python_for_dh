    "Transformer models are robust machine learning language models that are capable of solving many complex problems. It is beyond the scope of this textbook to explain the architecture of transformers or how they work precisely. Nevertheless, it is important to understand a few things. First, transformer models are particularly suited for working with multi-lingual documents. Second, they are powerful, but slow. Third, the way they represent texts is different from other language models in that they are able to change the vector, or numerical representation, of an individual word based on context. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes them particularly suited to the problem of topic modeling because they can convert each document into a numerical representation that is not a sequence of numbers that correspond to the presence of an individual word. Instead, transformer models can convert a document into a deeply semantic representation that retains the context and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to leverage transformer models, we need to install SentenceTransformers (from HuggingFace). We can do that with pip via the command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install sentence_transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will also be working with two other libraries: umap (for representing our complex numerical representation of documents in 2-dimensional space) and hdbscan (for finding clusters). UMAP has gained popularity in recent years as a quick, effectively, and fairly accurate way to represent higher dimensional data in lower dimensions. In Python, we can access the UMAP algorithm through the UMAP library which can be installed with pip by typing the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install umap-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `-learn` after `umap`. This is very important as `umap` is an entirely different library.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install hdbscan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our libraries are installed, we can begin importing them."

    "The first step in using transformers in topic modeling is to convert the text into a vector. We met vectors when we explored LDA topic modeling in the previous chapter. Arrays for LDA topic modeling were rooted in a bag-of-word (BOW) index. This index, while computationally light, did not retain semantic meaning or word order.\n",

    "When we are working with transformers, we can create a vector for each document in our dataset. This vector is not an index of the words used, rather it is an embedding for the entire document that contains its semantic usages of words. It also preserves in this same vector space the word order to a degree. This document vector is similar to the word vector that we met in Part Three of this textbook. Instead of embedding a single word, however, the entire document receives an embedding. This allows us to mathematically compare documents across an entire corpus.\n",

Fortunately, the Sentence Transformer library from HuggingFace allows us to easily load robust pre-trained language models. In our case, we will be using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

    "We have 4,579 outliers, or documents that do not neatly cluster into any one category. This is a clear limitation of this approach. What do we do with these outliers? One option is to assign them to the nearest topic. The process of doing this, however, can be quite complex as the we calculate distance between a document vector and a topic can vary depending on which measurements we wish to use. In the final section of this chapter, we will examine a library that handles this problem for us."
