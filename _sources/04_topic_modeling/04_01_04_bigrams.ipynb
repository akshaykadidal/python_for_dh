    "Let's take a moment and step away topic modeling. Instead, let's think about language. The essential medium of topic modeling is texts which are the products of language. And language is nothing more than a collection of words whose usage is rooted around grammar and syntax. A given word's meaning, in other words, is often defined by how, when, and where it is used in a given text. Words can also mean different things when used collectively."

    "This is an example of textual ambiguity. Syntactical context helps eliminate textual ambiguity. Apple is a single word here that contains a single concept. It's a relatively simple word. Perhaps one of the earliest a native speaker of English learns as a child. And yet it has textual ambiguity. Because \"apple\" is a single word, it is known as a unigram. A **unigram** is a single word that represents a single concept.\n",

    "Textual ambiguity, however, occurs in more dynamic ways when we think about concepts beyond the single span of a single word. In this section, we will focus on two such cases that are essential for natural language processing: bigrams and trigrams. **Bigrams** are two words that contain a distinct meaning when used together, while **trigrams** are three words that contain a distinct meaning when used together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding bigrams and trigrams are essential because in order for a computer to truly understand langauge the way a human does, it must be able to understand the nuances of a single word and how a word's meaning not only shifts in context, but shifts in meaning when used in conjunction with other words."
