In order to understand this process, it's best if we take a step back and think about how we assign topics as humans.\n",

    "**K-means** is a common method of clustering in data science and can be easily implemented via the Python library Scikit-Learn (see Part Two of this book). The K-means method of clustering takes in the textual data and places all documens in *k* number of clusters. In this scenario, the researcher assigns a numerical variable for *k*, so if the researcher wished to see all texts clustered into 10 topics, or clusters, the k-means algorithm would find the documents with the greatest degree of similarity and place them in the closest mean cluster. The result is a forced clustering of all texts neatly into 10 clusters. We can then discern their topics by examining the words that overlap between texts in each cluster. As we will see in Part Two, this can be tricky and invovles trial and error.\n",

Notice how all data (dots on the graph) are clustered into one of the three categories. This is the K-Means clustering method at work. Notice also how the blue dot in the top of the graph and the nearby red dots may have similarity or overlap, yet are clustered differently. This is the result of the absolute nature of K-Means clustering.\n",
