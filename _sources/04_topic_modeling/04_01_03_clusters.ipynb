    "**Topics** are labels assigned to textual data that detail the subjects contained within a given text.

In order to understand this process, it's best if we take a step back and think about how we assign topics as humans.\n",

No longer are the two topics of baseball and basketball relevant because `Text 3` and `Text 4` do not align well with those topics. Instead, a better pair of topics might be sports and cooking, or something like that. What changed? The collection of texts in our corpus changed.\n",
