    "\n",
    "1) Introduce the reader to the core concepts of topic modeling and text classification<br>\n",
    "2) Provide an introduction to three libraries used for traditional topic modeling (Scikit Learn, Gensim, and spaCy) for those with limited Python knowledge<br>\n",
    "3) Detail the problems and solutions to working with various topic modeling problems<br>\n",
    "4) Provide an overview of transformer-based topic modeling<br>\n",
    "5) Provide code that will be easily reproducible for readers who wish to apply these methods to their own domains.<br>\n",

    "Throughout this part of the textbook, we will work with one dataset, a collection of short descriptions of violence in Apartheid South Africa, which comes from Volume 7 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report (hereafter, TRC Vol. 7). I have chosen this dataset because I have experience with it and I know that the data is perfectly suited to topic modeling as hidden topics are found within it."
