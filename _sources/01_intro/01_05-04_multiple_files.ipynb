    "Often times, it is necessary to open multiple files in a Python script. There are multiple ways to do this, but unlike most Python textbooks. I recommend that beginners use the library called glob. <b>Glob</b> comes standard with Python which means you do not have to install it. A good way to think about glob is as a library that allows you to look into a directory and find all potential files based on certain parameters."
