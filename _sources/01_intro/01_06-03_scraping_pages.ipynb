    "The **requests** library allows us to send a signal via Python to server. A good way to think about requests is as an invisible browser that opens in the background of your computer. Requests does the precise thing your browser does. It sends a signal over the internet to connect to a specific server address. While all servers have a unique IP address. Often the internet links a specific and unique address that can be used as a way to connect to a server without having to type out an IP address. Unlike your browser, however, requests does not will up the results for you to see. Instead, it receives the return signal and simply stores the HTML data in memory.\n",

This particular response means that our attempt to connect to a server was successful. There are many types of responses, but 200 is the one we want to see. If you ever see a response that is not 200, you can Google the particular server response and you will find out what is happening. Sometimes, a response indicates that your request was blocked. This may be because the website has anti-web scraping measures in place. In other cases, the page may be protected, meaning that it lies behind a login. There are too many potential errors that may surface that I cannot detail them all in this basic introduction chapter. I will, however, give you a solution to a very common problem that can allow you to get around a common 403 response. For that solution, check out the final section of this chapter."
