    "In this section, we will meet classes. **Classes** are rather like data structures, but they differ in one significant way. They can have functions attached to them. When you create a class in Python, you are essentially creating a special kind of data object that can have functions. Functions embedded within classes are known as **methods**. You have actually already met methods. In chapter 02_01 when we first learned about strings, you may recall that when we altered the data, we used a \".\" after the string object name followed by the function (method) that we wanted to call, e.g. str1.replace(something, something_else). This is what separates a function from a method syntactically in python. While a function is called by itself, a method must be called from a class object. While there is no easy way to explain this distinction, I hope that this explanation will be aided by working with classes and methods at a closer level below."
