    "In this chapter, you will meet JSON data. JSON is a data format that is frequently used online. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is the principal way in which data is stored for websites and called by JavaScript. There are two reasons to learn JSON data structures early in your coding career.\n",

A good way to think about this is with the following data structure. Imagine you wanted to store a series of texts in Excel. In one column, you would have a text and then in the next column, you would store a list of speakers. Now, how do you represent the list of names? You could do it like this:"

    "If I want to update the data, I need to make sure that the list of ages corresponds to the list of names. Again, this can lead to issues down the road. The solution is to stop using CSV or Excel to store this type of data and use a format that is more flexible and able to handle things like lists and nested hierarchical data. In Python, the easiest solution is JSON. To use JSON, you do not need to install any special libraries. It comes prebuilt with a special library called JSON. The only methods you need to know to use JSON: json.dump() and json.load(). But first, let's import json."

Instead of naming this a .txt file, however, we will name is .json. Next, we will execute the command json.dump(). This will take 2 essential arguments: the data that you want to dump to the file and the object in which you want to dump the data, in this case \"f\". The other keyword argument here is indent.
