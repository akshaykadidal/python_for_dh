    "In part 7 of this textbook, we will learn about web scraping, one of the more vital skills of a digital humanist. <b>Web scraping</b> is process by which we automate the calling to a server (which hosts a website) and parsing the HTML file. <b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the way in which websites are structured. When we web scrape a website, we write rules for extracting pieces of information from it based on how that data is structured within the HTML. To be competent at web scraping, therefore, one must be able to understand and parse HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will break down HTML and you will learn the most common tags, such as div, p, strong, and span. You will also learn about attributes within these tags, such as href, class, and id. It is vital that you understand this before moving onto the next chapter in which we learn how to web scrape with Python."

    "In the above cell, we see a very simple HTML file structure. Note the use of carrots \"<\" and \">\". The first thing you may notice is that within the first set of carrots is the word \"div\". This is known as a div tag and it is one of the most common types of tags you will see within the HTML of a website. Jump ahead now to the bottom of the string and you will notice another div tag. There is something different with this one, however. Can you spot the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you said the \"/\" after the \"<\", you would be right! The first div tag is known as the <b>open tag</b> and the second div tag is known as the <b>close tag</b>. This tells a browser to parse this as a single block of data. Between these two tags, we have one piece of <b>nested data</b> Nested data is data that falls within a collection of tags. In our case, this is a <b>p tag</b>. P tags get their name from \"paragraph\". They are one of the essential types of tags you can expect to see. On websites, they are often used in the main content portion of the page and are used to break up texts. P tags allow your browser to understand how to render the HTML for you. When it sees a p tag, it will often separate it out from the paragraph above with a line break.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the early days of the internet, HTML files for websites were fairly simple on their structure, today that is no longer the case. It is very common for websites to have 20+layers deep of nested HTML structure. This is because websites are rarely written out by someone hard coding them. Instead, they are designed with user-friendly apps, such as Wordpress. They take user drag-and-drop input and features and convert it into robust HTML (and CSS - a subject for another day)."

The Capetians ruled continuously from 987 to 1792 and again from 1814 to 1848. The branches of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of Valois (until 1589), Bourbon (from 1589 until 1792 and from 1814 until 1830), and the Orléans (from 1830 until 1848).\n",

We then searched for the div tag that contains the main body of the page. In this case, it was a div tag whose attribute \"id\" corresponded to \"mw-content-text\". I thin searched for all of the \"p\" tags, or paragraphs within that body and printed off the the text if the text was not blank.

For now, inspect that page and see if you can find where the div tag whose id corresponds to \"mw-content-text\" is located in the HTML. It is okay if this is hard!
