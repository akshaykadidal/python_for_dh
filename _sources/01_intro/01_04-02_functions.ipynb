    "**Functions** exist in all programming languages. They allow you to write a set of code that can be used later in your program. They are essential because they allow you to not rewrite the same block of code over and over again. Good code is code that does not repeat. In other words, if your program has a task that it needs to do repetitively, then you should develop that code into a clean function (or class which we will meet in the next section).\n",

Parameters allow you to pass arguments to a function. These arguments can be used by the function to perform some sort of action by either manipulating that parameter or using it in some capacity to do some task. In the case of our function, the only parameter is `number`. If you are creating multiple parameters, these should be separated by a comma, as we will see below. Notice that parameters do not have quotation marks around them. This is because they are not strings, rather parameters that will function like variables inside the code of the function.\n",
    "\n",
