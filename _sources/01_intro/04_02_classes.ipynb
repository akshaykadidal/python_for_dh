    "In this chapter, you will meet classes. <b>Classes</b> are rather like data structures, but they differ in one significant way. They can have functions attached to them. When you create a class in Python, you are essentially creating a special kind of data object that can have functions. Functions embedded within classes are known as <b>methods</b>. You have actually already met methods. In chapter 02_01 when we first learned about strings, you may recall that when we altered the data, we used a \".\" after the string object name followed by the function (method) that we wanted to call, e.g. str1.replace(something, something_else). This is what separates a function from a method syntactically in python. While a function is called by itself, a method must be called from a class object. While there is no easy way to explain this distinction, I hope that this explanation will be aided by working with classes and methods at a closer level below."

They allow for you to have tight, neater code that will be easier to read and look polished and professional. They prevent the writing of duplicate code. While it may appear unnecessary at times to view your code through functions and classes, I highly encourage you to start looking at it that way.
