    "Libraries are common across all programming languages. They allow you to import large amounts of code that contain functions and classes that you can leverage in your own code. A good way to think about a library is as the old expression: \"don't reinvent the wheel\". Use what others have done! Open-source is open for a reason! People who make these libraries do it so that you don't have to solve certain problems. They've done it for you.\n",

If you have installed Python via Anaconda, as I recommended, then pip will be automatically put into your system's Path. <b>Path</b> on Windows is a way that your computer can understand commands for exe files that you have on your system. If you open the terminal and you type \"pip --version\". On Windows, the terminal is command prompt.\n",
