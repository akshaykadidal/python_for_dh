    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is when we train a system with known data. In the case of NER, we train a system with a series of texts with the entities appropriately annotated with their corresponding labels. **Unsupervised learning** occurs when you don't know the categories of your data. You give the system a series of data and allow it to learn and identify patterns on its own. This is most popularly used for topic modeling and k-means (beyond the scope of this notebook). Finally, there is **semi-supervised learning** which falls between these two.\n",

    "As noted above, supervised learning is the process by which a system learns from a set of inputs that have known labels. In order to train properly, the input data is divided into three categories: training data, validation data, and testing data. There is no set percentage to asign to each of these categories. A good rule of thumb, however, is save 20% of all annotated data for testing and then divide the remaining 80% 80/20 (testing/validation) ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two, training data and validation data, are given to the system that is trying to learn. It uses the training data to hone a statistical model via predetermined algorithms. It does this by making guesses about what the proper labels are. It then checks its accuracy against the labels provided and makes adjustments accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it is finished viewing and guessing across all the training data, the first epoch, or iteration over the data, is finished. At this stage, the model then tests its accuracy against the validation data. These are left out of the training process and give the system a sense of its overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the validation data is left out of the training process, it able to be used for mid-training testing (or validation) of its accuracy. The training data is then randomized and given back to the system for x number of epochs. Again, there is no standard for the number of epochs, but a good rule of thumb is to start at 10 and study the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model repeats this process for the set number of epochs, it is finished training. The model's accuracy can then be tested against the testing dataset to see how well it performs. The reason you want to keep the testing data separate from the validation data is because, despite being not include in the training, some of the validation data seeps into the training process. Because the testing data is well-annotated, the researcher can get an accurate sense of how well that model performs.\n",

    "With that first model saved, it is common practice to adjust the parameters of the model multiple times to try to create a more accurate model. All models will be tested against the same testing data.\n",

    "In the last notebook, I explained when to use rules-based NER. Machine learning NER is useful when you cannot possible account for all variances of the entities in a corpus or creating such patterns would be so computationally expensive that its accuracy is not worth its use. A good example of this is every potential variation of a person's name. Consider the immense quantity of names that exist in the world and the combinations and various ways those names can be combined to create a unique entity. Even if we only have 10,000 first names and 10,000 last names, to account for all variations would be 100,000,000 million patterns to match. And there are far more than simple 10,000 of each in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another time to consider machine learning is when the data that will be fed to your system will not be entirely cleaned. Consider the example of names once again. Even if you had a system that could account for all 100,000,000 forms of those names, it will miss ones that have poor OCR or ones that have different text encoding because it was a text created prior to UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these instances machine learning is the right choice because machine learning NER models do not memorize entities. They learn entities. This means that if a model encounters an entity it has never seen before (even if poorly OCRed), it has the ability to **generalize** and identify that entity with the correct label."
