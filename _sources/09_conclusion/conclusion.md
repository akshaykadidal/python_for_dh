# Conclusion

This textbook has introduced you to some of the key concepts and terminology associated with Python. It has also given you the tools necessary to begin applying Python to your own projects. While Part 1 sought to give you the basic coding skills necessary to begin programming in Python, the later parts of this textbook gave you the basis to begin applying Python to specific digital humanities problems, from data analysis with Pandas, to NLP with spaCy, topic modeling with Top2Vec, social network analysis with NetworkX and PyVis, and how to create applications in short time with Streamlit.

While this textbook was not able to cover all aspects of Python or even all the ways to apply it in the digital humanities, you should now have a resource to return to for code and exposition on key methods. This will not be the end of your programming journey, rather the beginning. From here, you can begin to learn on your own and expand your knowledge.
