    "When working with large quantities of data, it can often be difficult to present that data in a way that makes sense to non-experts. In these situations, we often rely on some form of chart to represent our data. Creating quality graphs in Python requires a lot of practice, but quality charts can be produced with Matplotlib, Altair, PyDeck, PyVis, Plotly, and Bokeh. Each has their own strengths. In this section, we will not go into these libraries, rather we will focus on how to present these different types of graphs in Streamlit.\n",

    "We can plot basic graphs in Streamlit by passing a Pandas dataframe to different chart widgets in Streamlit. The first basic plot we can create is a line chart which we can create with the Streamlit widget `st.line_chart()`. We will be working with the Titanic dataset here that we first met in Part Two of this textbook. To prepare the data for visualization, we need to modify it a bit and group everything by the specific value that we want to plot. In our case, we want to visualize the number of survivors for different age groups on the Titanic. We can prepare our dataframe with the code below.\n",

    "A lot of digital humanities data is geospatial, or data that can be plotted on a map. Streamlit affords the ability to map geospatial data in several different ways; first, via the standard `st.map()` widget and second via the third-party chart libraries. Regardless of the library used, you will want to prepare your data well where your coordinates are labeled as either `lat` or `latitude` for the latitude and `lon` or `longitude` for the longitude. For this demonstration, we will be working with data from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that we met in Part Four of this textbook when we explores Social Network Analysis.\n",
