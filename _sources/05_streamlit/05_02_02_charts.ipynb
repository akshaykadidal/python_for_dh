    "When working with large quantities of data, it can often be difficult to present that data in a way that makes sense to non-experts. In these situations, we often rely on some form of chart to represent our data. Creating quality graphs in Python requires a lot of practice, but quality charts can be produced with Matplotlib, Altair, PyDeck, PyVis, Plotly, and Bokeh. Each has their own strengths. In this section, we will not go into these libraries, rather we will focus on how to present these different types of graphs in Streamlit.\n",

    "Before we address plots, we should spend a brief moment and think about how we display raw numerical quantitative data. We could display the length of a dataframe or the word count of some text `st.write()`. Again, while this would be quick to do, it would not allow you to display other important information, such as how that number has changed from a previous state. Nor would it allow you to easily represent the change in a positive or negative direction without complex JavaScript and HTML. In these scenarios, we would want to use `st.metric()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the metric will display a numerical output of some sort. This number could also be a string representation of a number, e.g. temperature. Let's say, we wanted to create a simple application where a user could copy-and-paste some text into a `st.text_area()` field. The app would split up the words at every white space and then provide the user with the total word count.\n",

To do this, we will need to leverage the Streamlit Session State, which we will meet later in this chapter. This allows us to store a variable across different runs of the application. For now, we can ignore this bit of the code below and focus on the third argument that we passed to metric, `change`. This will display a change feature in the widget that will show the up or down trend of the change in green and red color, respectively.\n",

    "A lot of digital humanities data is geospatial, or data that can be plotted on a map. Streamlit affords the ability to map geospatial data in several different ways; first, via the standard `st.map()` widget and second via the third-party chart libraries. Regardless of the library used, you will want to prepare your data well where your coordinates are labeled as either `lat` or `latitude` for the latitude and `lon` or `longitude` for the longitude. For this demonstration, we will be working with data from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that we met in Part Four of this textbook when we explores Social Network Analysis.\n",
