    "Being able to make more modular, custom, and dynamic applications means getting to know how to leverage advanced features in Streamlit when it comes to working with data stored in memory. In Streamlit, we have two ways to store data in memory, either by caching the data with `@st.cache()` or with the `st.session_state`."

    "When working with large data-driven projects, run time will become an issue with Streamlit. This is because Streamlit reruns the Python file each time something changes in the application. With large datasets, this means that each time a user does anything within your application, Streamlit will need to reload all the data. For this reason, it is essential to know how to store large datasets (or models) in cache so that Streamlit does not need to reload large memory-intensive data or models each item it reruns.\n",

    "We can cache our data with an `@st.cache()` above a function that loads the data. If we wanted to load our Titanic dataset and store it in memory, therefore, we would use the following code snippet.\n",

    "Aside from storing large data with cache, we can also store previous states of data with the `st.session_state`. The Streamlit Session State gives greater flexibility to an application.
