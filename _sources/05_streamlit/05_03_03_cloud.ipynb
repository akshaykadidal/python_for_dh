Fortunately, Streamlit offers a free Streamlit Share service that lets users share their apps for free. This section of the notebook will walk you through this process."

If you are just starting out with GitHub, getting used to Git can be a bit daunting. Git is powerful, but has a steep learning curve. It allows you to maintain your code, especially in teams, and version control everything. This means that your code is always backed up and you can access previous versions of your code at any single time.\n",
